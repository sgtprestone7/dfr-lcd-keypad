None of the samples, really exercised the LCD keypad to my satisfaction.  Included is event driven callbacks on buttonUp, buttonDown, and buttonHeld longer than an interval.  Settable backlight level.  Demo program explores user defined characters,  and selectable modes: character display; mouse mode.  In character display mode, the default on startup, displays value and character, left and right buttons advance characters, up and down change backlight intensity.  Select button changes modes. Mouse mode move a blinking cursor around using up, down, left and right keys.
